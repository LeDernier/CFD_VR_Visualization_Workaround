# CFD Visualization VR Workaround
Workaround for the use of a Head-Mounted Display for CFD visualization on Linux.

## Softwares Used
This workaround uses the following softwares :

* [OpenHMD](http://www.openhmd.net/)
* [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/)
* [SteamVR](https://steamcommunity.com/steamvr)
* [OpenVR](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr)

## Hardware tested
* The Headset tested was the [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/rift/).
* A GTX1060 MaxQ graphic card was used.
* The computer tested had 8 GB of RAM.
* The linux distribution tested was [Archlinux](https://www.archlinux.org/).

## Instructions
See the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file for the informations about installation.
See the [USE.md](USE.md) file for the informations about using all installed softwares.

## Results
When tested, it was not comfortable enough. Some effort could be done to make it better. The HTC Vive should be tried, and it should be tested on a windows system too.
